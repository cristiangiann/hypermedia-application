\section{Comments on the results}
	At the end of the evaluation, \textit{Lemon Peel} website seems to match the users' needs in terms of usability and expectations. However, during the test, small weaknesses have been found while seeing users interacting with it.\\
	These weaknesses are mostly related to sections and interaction items that are not immediately visible to the users: they are the \textit{Past Events} section, that is compressed by default at the end of the \textit{Events} page, and the dropdown menus used in \textit{Events} and \textit{Musical Instruments} pages. It looks like the users focus on the left side of the page while they are looking for information or interaction items, and the dropdown menus are not visible enough. It should be remembered that all the tests were made with a large-size screen and the considerations about the horizontal positions of the items are related to them.\\
	Among the strenghts, the simplicity of the website and the links to immediately go from an item page to a related one make the navigation fluent and it accompanies the user on his path.
