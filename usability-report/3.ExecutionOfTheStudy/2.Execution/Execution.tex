\section{Execution}\label{Execution-paragraph}
	In order to have reliable data, six users have been recruited for the test.\\
	At the beginning it has been explained to them the purpose of the test, its structure and their possibility to give up for any task or for the entire test if they did not want to continue anymore. Then, a short presentation of \textit{Lemon Peel} association and the sharing of the url of the website followed, asking them to share the screen with the two evaluators, connected with them through a videocall.\\
	The order of the tasks has been randomized for each user to minimize the learning effect; each of them started from the homepage. The proceeding of the tasks have been supervised by the evaluators who wrote down the successes, the durations and the path followed by the users.\\
	After the completion of the task phase, it has been asked to the users to complete a survey based on their experience using the website. The survey consists of ten mandatory statements to evaluate, choosing among five opinions: \textit{Strongly disagree}, \textit{Disagree}, \textit{Neutral}, \textit{Agree}, \textit{Strongly agree}.\\
	Below, an optional comment section has been added asking for free comments about the evaluating process, the website or the experience the user had.
	The survey contains the following statements:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[S\subs{1}] The website was easy to use (used to measure variable \textit{V6});
		\item[S\subs{2}] I found the website unnecessarily complex (\textit{V6});
		\item[S\subs{3}] I immediately felt confident using the website (\textit{V5}, \textit{V6});
		\item[S\subs{4}] During the navigation I felt lost once or more (\textit{V4});
		\item[S\subs{5}] I could quickly get the information I needed (\textit{V5});
		\item[S\subs{6}] The content was easy to read (\textit{V7});
		\item[S\subs{7}] The content was well structured (\textit{V7});
		\item[S\subs{8}] The structure of the pages helped me to locate information I needed (\textit{V4});
		\item[S\subs{9}] I found inconsistencies among the pages (\textit{V7});
		\item[S\subs{10}] Homepageâ€™s content made me want to explore the website (\textit{V7}).
	\end{itemize}
