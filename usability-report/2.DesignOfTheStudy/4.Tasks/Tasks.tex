\section{Tasks}
	Four tasks have been chosen to be asked to the users for the evaluation of the usability of \textit{Lemon Peel} website. They have been shuffled each time to minimize the learning effect on them.\\
	The chosen tasks are not very complex, but the website does not have a complex structure and they represent some realistic use cases of the website. The tasks are the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Task 1:
			\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
				\item Find the date and time of the last event;
				\item Find the email of the organiser of that event.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Task 2:
			\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
				\item Discover the name of the bagpipe invented in Emilia Romagna;
				\item Find the time of the course of that instrument.
			\end{enumerate}	
		\item Task 3:
			\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
				\item Find the address of \textit{Lemon Peel} office.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Task 4:
			\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
				\item Find the name of the instruments that have the same type of \textit{Vattacicirchie};
				\item Discover which parts a \textit{Vattacicirchie} is composed by.
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{itemize}
