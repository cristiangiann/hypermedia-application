\section{User Profile Definition}
	The definition of a standard user profile to test the web application allows to make the results comparable and to have a reliable feedback based on multiple experiences.\\
	Unfortunately, due to the pandemic and the difficulty to phisically reach people who do not have a proper workstation, it would have been impossible to set the standard user profile as the typical person who might be interested to the website (according to the evaluators, a person between 30 and 50 years old who enjoys folk italian music and speaks english fluently, due to the language of the contents). So the decision fell on students between 22 and 25 years old with music interests and a decent experience with technology; they must have a computer, a microphone, a webcam and the possibility to share the screen with their interviewers.
