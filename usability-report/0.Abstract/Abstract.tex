\begin{abstract}
	The aim of this Usability Report is to describe the results of a usability evaluation executed on the \textit{Lemon Peel} website, carried out with the \textit{user testing} method. This method consists on the data collection and observation of how some representatives of real users use the system. \\
	Its goal is to uncover actual difficulties that users have when interacting with the website and to obtain a systematic feedback on the effectiveness and efficiency of use of it.
