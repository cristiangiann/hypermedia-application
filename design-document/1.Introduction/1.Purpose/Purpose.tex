\section{Purpose}
Lemon Peel is an italian no-profit organization that operates in the traditional music field. Lemon Peel recognizes that in the last years fewer and fewer people are interested to italian traditional music that are part of the culture of the country, so it offers free courses to teach how to play the instruments that have been invented in the Italian territory during the last centuries, to avoid the disappearance of this piece of history regarding the Italian traditional music.
