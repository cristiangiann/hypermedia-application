\section{Kinds of Topic}
	\subsection{Musical Instrument}
		\textit{Musical Instrument} page contains the name, the description and the history of the instrument itself. If there is a course of that instrument, a link to the relative course shows up. There might be very simple instruments that have no course (e.g. Triccheballacche is a percussion instrument that can produce a single sound). \textit{Related instruments} are other \textit{Musical instruments} that are from the same region or of the same instrument type.

	\subsection{Person}

The page contains the name, a profile image and a biography of the \textit{Person}, and a contact section, with email and phone number. If this \textit{Person} is a teacher, the page contains also links to her \textit{Courses}.
