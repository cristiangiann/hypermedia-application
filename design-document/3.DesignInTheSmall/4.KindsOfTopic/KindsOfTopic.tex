	\subsection{Musical Instrument}
		Musical Instrument page contains the name, the description and the history of the instrument itself. If there is a course of that instrument, a link to the relative course shows up. There might be very simple instruments that have no course (e.g. Triccheballacche is a percussion instrument with a single sound). Related instruments are other musical instruments that are from the same region or of the same instrument type.
