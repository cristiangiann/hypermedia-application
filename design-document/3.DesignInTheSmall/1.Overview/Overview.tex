\section{Overview}
	Design in-the-small chapter contains the graphical structure of the main pages of the website. Each page is represented by a low-fidelity wireframe, that shows what the page offers and the basic visual organization of the content, of the navigation and of the interaction elements on the screen, and a high-fidelity prototype, that shows sample elements on the screen and defines all their visual properties. In each page all the links are underlined, labeled with their type, and explained in a short description before the two images.
