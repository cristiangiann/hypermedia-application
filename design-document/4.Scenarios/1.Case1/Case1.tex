\section{Case 1}

    Giorgio is a 80 years old man from South Italy, with a passion for technology and old musical instruments. He has heard of an association in his town whose aim is to teach how to play Italian musical instruments of the past but also anything related to popular and folk music of 19th and 20th century and he's interested in learning more about it.
	\newline Accessing the \textit{Lemon Peel} website, he clicks the \textit{Next Event} link from the \textit{Home Page} to check when he might learn more about the Association in person. From the description he notices that the only purpose of the \textit{Event} is to present the new courses, but he would like to know if there will be someone who play some old instruments. So, he clicks on the \textit{Event organizer} link, where he finds her contacts to ask more information about it.
