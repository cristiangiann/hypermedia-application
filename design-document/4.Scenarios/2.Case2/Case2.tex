\section{Case 2}

	Amanda is a 17 years old girl who founds a vintage instrument in her house's basement and she wants to learn more about it. She knows that there is an association whose aim is to teach the history of traditional Italian music and instruments.
	\newline She opens the website and clicks on the \textit{Musical Instruments} link in the navigation bar; then, she finds that the ocarina, by its picture, is very similar to the instrument she has at home.
	From the \textit{Musical Instrument} page she reads the story behind it and she finds that there is a course to learn how to play this instrument, so she clicks on the \textit{Go to course} button to have more information about the day and time of each lesson to participate.
