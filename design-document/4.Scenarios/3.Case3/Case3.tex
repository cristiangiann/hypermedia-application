\section{Case 3}

	Ippolito is a middle-age man who owns a large collection of historical musical instruments of the past. He knows how to play many of them and he would like to teach it to people who are interested in traditional music.
	\newline He goes on the \textit{Lemon Peel} association website and clicks on the \textit{Courses} landmark. He notices that in the page there is no reference to Bagh√®t courses, a bagpipe from Bergamo that he knows very well. Aiming to teach how to play it, he clicks on \textit{Contacts} landmark to ask to the association if they might be interested to offer this new \textit{Course}. Then, he writes a message explaining what he could bring to the association and clicks on \textit{Submit} button.
