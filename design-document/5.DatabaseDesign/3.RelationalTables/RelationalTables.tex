\section{Relational Tables}
	This section shows the logical schema of  the domain modeled in the ER diagram of the previous section, independently of a particular database management product or storage technology.
	
	As it can be seen, the \textit{Contact\_Form\_Data} does not participate in any relationship as it models only a contact form on the website.
