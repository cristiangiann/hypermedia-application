      history:

          \ ocarina from a toy, which only played a few notes, into a more comprehensive\
          \ instrument (known as the first \"classical\" ocarinas). The word ocarina\
          \ in the Bolognese dialect of the Emiliano-Romagnolo language means \"little\
          \ goose.\" The earlier form was known in Europe as a gemshorn, which was\
          \ made from animal horns of the chamois (Dutch: gems). The ocarina is an\
          \ ancient wind musical instrument—a type of vessel flute. Variations exist,\
          \ but a typical ocarina is an enclosed space with four to twelve finger\
          \ holes and a mouthpiece that projects from the body. It is traditionally\
          \ made from clay or ceramic, but other materials are also used—such as plastic,\
