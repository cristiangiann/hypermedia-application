                            <h4>3.1 - Web Architecture</h4>
                            <p>Amazon Web Services has been chosen for the architecture of Lemon Peel website.</p>
                            <p>The active services are two: Ec2 to run the server and Amazon RDS to configure a MySQL database.</p>
                            <p>
                                The Ec2 instance (t3.micro) contains a running Node JS server created with Swagger and then modified to fit the needs of the application.
                                Static contents are stored into the Ec2 machine and served by <i>serve-static</i> module,
                                while it's possibile to retrieve the data stored into the database only through API calls.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The MySQL database, a db.t2.micro instance created with Amazon RDS, is configured to be accessible only by the Ec2 machine for security reasons.
                                To retrieve or send data, the clients must ask what they need to the server that will query the database and send back the responses.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The data with which the pages are filled are retrieved with AJAX calls to the NodeJS server,
                                so that the HTML pages are not rendered server side but in the local machine of the user.
                            </p>

                                <h5>3.2.1 - REST compliance</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Checking online documentation about the REST principles, five main architectural constraints have been followed
                                    to ensure the service to be considered REST:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Every resource is retrievable from a unique URI and it contains a source to fetch related data,
                                            in accordance with HATEOAS principles. All the resources are accessible through a HTTP GET request.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Client and server can be developed independently and evolve separately with no dependency from each other.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Interaction between client and server is stateless. The server does not store any information about the previous
                                            requests and it is able to properly respond to one only by checking it. The server does not need any history
                                            of received requests.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Resources are cacheable. It improves the performance both server and client side: the client does not need to wait
                                            for a response and the server avoids wasting of computation.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The application architecture is composed by three layers: presentation, application and data.
                                            Each layer can interact only with the following one, in order to divide responsibility among them
                                            and making them focused on specific tasks.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                <p>
                                    The models introduced for data use resources that correspond to relevant items for Lemon Peel association.
                                    For the first four entities, a second model has been introduced, called "preview" (Person preview, Event preview, ...),
                                    that contains name and image of a specific item, used to be incorporated in the pages that contain a link to them,
                                    so that the navigation is facilitated for the users. 
                                    The resources are the following:
                                    <ul>

                            The following image represents the ER diagram used to build the database of the application.
                            Intermediate tables have been used to break the n to n relations. The main resources are mapped to the table that has their name,
                            and all the fields described into it, while the preview of the linked objects are taken from the relative tables.

                            because of the 0:1 - 0:1 relation. Preview information (name and image) about teachers of that course are retrieved from the Person table
                            passing through the intermediate table that maps courses to people (due to 1:n - 1:n relation between them).

                                Then, with the help of <i>knex</i> module, the MySQL database has been connected to the server,
                                safely storing its credentials using <i>dotenv</i> module.

                            <p>
                                Moreover, PM2 (Process Manager for NodeJS) is used on the server. It is configured to run the node application automatically
                                when the machine starts, managing three instances of the server at the same time and acting as a load balancer between them.

                                    Swagger helped in the control of the APIs specified with OpenAPI editor. It validates the requests made by the client
                                    checking if they respect the specification described in the yaml file. The resposes of GET requests reflect the structure
                                    of database entities and are enriched with linked objects when needed. The concept of <i>preview</i> helped to easily maintain
                                    the focus on the structure of the response, avoiding continuous checks on its many fields.
                                    The only POST request of the website, used to send a message, is controlled by Swagger that checks if all the needed parameters
                                    have been set.

                                    To comply to REST specification, we divided static contents from data needed to fill the page sections.
                                    The data are fetched with AJAX calls from the client; they are embedded in scripts among the static contents, retrieved
                                    and executed in the client browser that makes a request to the server and waits a response to fill the page with the received data.

                                    A relational database has been used for the data layer. The used technology is an RDS MySQL, provided by AWS,
                                    and the interaction with it is permitted only from the web server IP for security reasons. The database queries have been
                                    managed with <i>knex</i> node module, that prevents SQL injections and allows minimal changes if a future decision
                                    will make replace the database.

                                Partial inspiration has been taken from Wired website that uses REST APIs to retrieve the latest news by category from the server.
                                Even if Wired website is significantly different from Lemon Peel one, it has been useful to see how the data are structured
                                in the response body and how they are used to compose a small part of the home page.
                                In particular, how information about the authors and about the categories of the articles are ritrieved together with the article data
                                in its API response and how images links are included in the data.
                                These information helped during the design process of Lemon Peel website.

                            Cristian Giannetti has an small internship experience in web application, using Ruby on Rails and React,
                            where he integrated some features to an existing application.
                            He thinks that the most valuable outcome for him is creating a web application from scratch,
                            following all the needed steps to transform ideas to a working prototype, and the configuration of cloud platforms for web development,
                            that will be essentials for his next job.
